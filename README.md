The goal of this project is to apply the concepts and general methods  of scalability. 
It includes a Python source code and an essay/technical annex that describes  the analysis of the problems and the algorithmic solution,  
in addition to the scalability analysis of the code, tested against random instances of the problem.
For details, see the technical annex and the attached Python code.
